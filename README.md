# radio.wav

radio.wav is a radio streaming web application that streams global radio stations based on user input. A global radio station is randomly selected and streamed based on the music genre filter the user selects.
Key technologies used in development include React for front-end rendering of UI components, Tailwind for styling, Axios for fetching radio data from the API, and Javascript to execute code.

Radio-browser-api was used to fetch radio data. Learn more about it here: https://github.com/ivandotv/radio-browser-api.
